# jQuery Playground

jQuery Playground (referred to as "jQuery Basics" in the project) is a basic web application that allows users to
interact with HTML elements using fundamental jQuery operations. This web application is based on Brad
Traversy's [jQuery Crash Course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/jquery_crash_course). However, the code in this
repository differs greatly from the original as it utilizes data abstraction, allows for seamless navigation among
different jQuery topics, includes thorough documentation, etc.

## Setup

First, make sure that you have installed **Node.js** and **npm**. You can install them
using [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download). To ensure that you have them installed on your local machine, input
the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

Second, install **live-server**.

```bash
$ npm install -g live-server
```

To ensure that you have live-server installed on your local machine, input the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ live-server -v
```

## Installation

Now, `git clone` this repository, and navigate to the `jquery-basics` directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JayBhatt2021/jquery-playground.git
$ cd jquery-playground
$ cd jquery-basics
```

## Usage

From the `jquery-basics` directory, use the following live-server command to run this web application:

```bash
$ live-server --port=3720
```

Finally, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3720/html/selectors.html in the browser.
